# Introduction

C++ game engine developed entirelly while streaming the process on YouTube. This
is not the first time I am doing something like this engine, but is the first
time I've decided to stream the process. I am learning the process of graphics
programming and engine development since Jan/2024 and by no means am experienced
but it is something I would like to do more in the future.  
I've also started learning C++ at the same time with the purpose of game development
my background is web development, Angular, React, Java, Node.js, I've tried game
development with Javascript first but decided to go all in and actually learn a language
more apropriate for gamedev.

I've tried comercial game engines like Unity, Unreal and Godot by it's not for me,
I just don't like the excess of tools and information that I would never use and
I just feel overwhelmed with the environment, thats why I prefer doing my own
thing.
